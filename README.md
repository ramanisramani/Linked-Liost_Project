Specification
Problem: The owner of a small theater in an isolated town in Montana has hired you to develop the
backend for an online ticket reservation system. to handle the customer demand. Your program will allow
attendees to select seats and display the current seating arrangement. At the end of the program, a report

earned. Given what you know from the previous version (Project 1), your task is to update the system
with a more dynamic solution.
